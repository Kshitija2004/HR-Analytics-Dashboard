# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Created a dashboard to track employee attrition rate

This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard designed to help organizations understand employee data and identify key factors contributing to employee attrition.
The main objective is to provide data-driven insights that support better HR decision-making, employee retention strategies, and workforce planning.

Objective of the Project:
Analyze employee attrition trends
Identify high-risk employee groups
Enable HR teams to take preventive actions

Instead of using raw HR data, this dashboard converts it into visual insights that are easy to understand.
